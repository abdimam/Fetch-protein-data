# Fetch-protein-data
This script can fetch protein data though uniprots API, with an additional feature which is generating a FASTA files for each (top) hit in the search.

There is three reasons why I made this script:

The first reason is that during my education as a biotechnologist, we never actually dwelled into APIs so I took the freedom to test my skills if I would be able to featch data from an API.
The second reason is that because I am currently working in a lab I try to keep my programming skills up to date.
Lasty, this would have been of good use during my master thesis (Please, check out!) so I hope I might help someone in the future that needs a quick way to generate FASTA files with similar sequences.
