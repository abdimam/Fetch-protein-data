# Fetch-protein-data
This script can fetch protein data though uniprots API, with an additional feature which is generating a FASTA files for each (top) hit in the search.

# Use
Just run it and give the right input that is asked in the terminal, please note that this is NOT optimized for any sort of use, AKA this is FAR AWAY from user friendly so please, just type what is asked from you from the prompts given to you in the terminal.

# Why did I make this?
There is three reasons why I made this script:

The first reason is that during my education as a biotechnologist, we never actually dwelled into APIs so I took the freedom to test my skills if I would be able to featch data from an API.
The second reason is that because I am currently working in a lab I try to keep my programming skills up to date.
Lasty, this would have been of good use during my master thesis (Please, check out!) so I hope I might help someone in the future that needs a quick way to generate FASTA files with similar sequences.
